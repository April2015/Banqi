# Banqi

Banqi (Chinese: 半棋; pinyin: bànqí) or Half Chess,
also known as Dark Chess (暗棋) or Blind Chess (盲棋),
is a two-player Chinese board game played on a 4x8 grid, or half of the xiangqi (Chinese Chess) board.
Most games last between ten and twenty minutes, but advanced games can go on for an hour or more.
Banqi is a social game, usually played for fun rather than serious competition.
